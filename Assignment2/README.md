# In-Class Collaboration

Dylan Inafuku and Rahul Sura:
- We discussed different approaches to the assignment with regards to hyperparameter tuning and ideas to avoid long RF train times
- We also tried to research and find libraries that could help create GradCAM visualizations for the CNN model.

# GitHub Repository and Data File

- Link to the repository: [Assignment 2](https://github.com/shmurthy08/Computer_Vision_SPRING_2024/tree/main/Assignment2)

- Link to the data file: [CamSeq07](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/camseq-semantic-segmentation)

# Code Notes:

- Code Compiles and runs properly
- Code can produce other images that aren't used in the report, these images helped me flesh out my report even though it wasn't included. The code for these images are committed in the repository. 
- Tried to push cnn model, random forest model, and preprocessed github was not able to handle the size of the files and caused tons of issues when reverting the push and fixing my git history.
