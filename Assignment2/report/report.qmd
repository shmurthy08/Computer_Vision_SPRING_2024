# 1. Introduction

Semantic segmentation involves classifying every pixel in an image to a specific class. For this report, I used the `CamSeq07` model which contains 202 images and masks. The goal of this project was to analyze how well a CNN and Random Forest model can perform on semantic segmentation. The CNN model was trained using the `U-Net` architecture and the Random Forest model was trained using the `RandomForestClassifier` from the `sklearn` library. Before I created the CNN architecture, I used the Random Forest model to decide if deep learning was required.

## 1.1 Random Forest Analysis

For the Random Forest (RF) model, I created a 70/30 train-test split and trained the model using the following parameters.
